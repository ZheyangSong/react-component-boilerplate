# react-component-boilerplate
A project boilerplate for creating a React Component in TSX

* The `component` folder is where your componet's implementation resides
* The `example` folder hosts some harness code for running your component in browser during development
* Most of the time, you'll only be modifying the `example/app.tsx` to hook your component into the harness code

## Please feel free to raise PRs to make this boilerplate better. Thanks.
